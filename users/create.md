# Create User

As an Administrator, I would like the ability to create new Users, so that people may have permission to work with the Repository as required for content stewardship.

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Allow for Penn State, Admin, and Guest user roles
- [ ] Allow permissions to be assigned to User on create
