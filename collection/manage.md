# Manage Collection

As an Administrative User (?), I would like to be able to perform collection management activities in the Repository, so that I can ensure my collections continue to meet user needs.

## CONTENTdm

Web interface
Project Client

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Allow a User (with permissions) to configure example Works
- [ ] Allow thumbnails to be customized ([CHO-169](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/169))

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Export BagIt bags ([CHO-442](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/442))
- [ ] Split and merge collections ([CHO-58](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/58))
