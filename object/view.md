# View Work

As a User, I would like a page about each Work in the Public User Interface, so that I can see all of the metadata and representations of the Work in one place.

## CONTENTdm

["Coffee Coolers"](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/Forbes/id/6/rec/2)
[Insurance Maps of Shamokin, Northumberland Co., Pennsylvania, April 1907](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/maps1/id/23890/rec/3)

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Display metadata describing the Work ([CHO-83](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/83))
- [ ] Display transcripts of textual Works ([CHO-146](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/146))
- [ ] Allow downloads of transcripts of textual Works ([CHO-91](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/91))
- [ ] Allow a User to request the original Work, if available ([CHO-130](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/130)) (integration with Aeon or ArchivesSpace)
- [ ] Highlight search terms in a Work or its metadata, if a User accesses the Work from search results ([CHO-568](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/568))
- [ ] Export standard citations ([CHO-30](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/30))
- [ ] Display use and reuse conditions for a Work ([CHO-45](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/45))
    * Tooltips for rights statements; links to full rights and license statements when available, e.g. rightsstatements.org, creativecommons.org)

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Display GIS attributes for GIS works
- [ ] Suggest related Works ([CHO-111](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/111)) (Relate on: subject, collection, author, time period, etc.)
- [ ] Suggest related undigitized materials ([CHO-43](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/43))
- [ ] Allow a User to request digitization of related (un-digitized) materials ([CHO-26](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/26))
- [ ] Allow a User to request a reproduction of a Work ([CHO-229](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/229))
- [ ] Share Works on social media ([CHO-180](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/180))
