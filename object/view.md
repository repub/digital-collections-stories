# View Work

As a User, I would like a page about each Work in the Public User Interface, so that I can see all of the metadata and representations of the Work in one place.

## CONTENTdm

["Coffee Coolers"](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/Forbes/id/6/rec/2)
[Insurance Maps of Shamokin, Northumberland Co., Pennsylvania, April 1907](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/maps1/id/23890/rec/3)

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Display metadata describing the Work ([CHO-83](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/83))
- [ ] Display transcripts of textual Works ([CHO-146](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/146))
- [ ] Allow downloads of transcripts of textual Works ([CHO-90](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/90), [CHO-91](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/91))
- [ ] Allow a User to request the original Work, if available ([CHO-130](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/130)) (integration with Aeon or ArchivesSpace)
- [ ] Highlight search terms in a Work or its metadata, if a User accesses the Work from search results ([CHO-568](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/568))
- [ ] Export standard citations ([CHO-30](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/30))
- [ ] Display use and reuse conditions for a Work ([CHO-45](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/45))
    * Tooltips for rights statements; links to full rights and license statements when available, e.g. rightsstatements.org, creativecommons.org)
- [ ] Be indexed by search engines ([CHO-116](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/116))
- [ ] Show all Object/Collection relationships ([CHO-60](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/60))
- [ ] Allow viewing of files and file sets ([CHO-63](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/63))
- [ ] Allow downloading of files and file sets ([CHO-73](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/73), [CHO-74](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/74), [CHO-649](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/649))
- [ ] Allow full-text searching within a textual object ([CHO-135](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/135))

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Display GIS attributes for GIS works
- [ ] Suggest related Works ([CHO-111](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/111)) (Relate on: subject, collection, author, time period, etc.)
- [ ] Suggest related undigitized materials ([CHO-43](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/43))
- [ ] Allow a User to request digitization of related (un-digitized) materials ([CHO-26](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/26))
- [ ] Allow a User to request a reproduction of a Work ([CHO-229](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/229))
- [ ] Share Works on social media ([CHO-180](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/180))
- [ ] Have AMP support ([CHO-215](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/215))
- [ ] Allow users to export metadata ([CHO-21](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/21))
- [ ] Allow users to tag objects with their own keywords ([CHO-35](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/35))
- [ ] Allow users to annotate objects ([CHO-147](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/147))
- [ ] Allow for crowdsourced transcription, either natively or via integration with a third-party application such as Omeka (see [DIY History](https://diyhistory.lib.uiowa.edu) at the University of Iowa) or [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org)
- [ ] Display transcripts during media playback ([CHO-24](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/24))
- [ ] Allow side-by-side comparison of two Objects in a single viewer ([CHO-155](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/155))
- [ ] Allow geo-referencing ([CHO-114](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/114))
    * Is the User doing geo-referencing from scratch, or making use of geospatial metadata we have already provided? Does the Repository sufficiently allow for re-use of geospatial metadata for georeferencing use cases? How similar is this to some of the other geospatial user stories in this document?
- [ ] Search transcripts of A/V works, link to timecode in media ([CHO-76](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/76))
    * Kaltura may allow this
- [ ] Allow topic model browsing of objects ([CHO-92](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/92))
- [ ] Allow saving or bookmarking of objects within the repository ([CHO-113](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/113))
- [ ] Allow downloading of specific segments of an audiovisual object ([CHO-136](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/136)) (Kaltura might allow this)
- [ ] Allow linking to a specific timecode of an audiovisual object ([CHO-137](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/137)) (Kaltura might allow this)
