# Create Collection

As a Curator, I would like the ability to create new Collections, so that I may have a place to create and organize Works.

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Allow any user to curate their own Collections ([CHO-23](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/23), [CHO-409](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/409))
    - [ ] Share Curated Collections with others ([CHO-125](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/125))
    - [ ] Download Curate Collection objects and metadata in a batch ([CHO-131](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/131))
    * The newest release of CONTENTdm (March 2020) allows users to save a list of items and manage that list in its public user interface. We can't immediately take advantage of this since the only "users" of CONTENTdm here are staff with curatorial or management responsibility, but it could be worth looking into...

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Allow Collections to be nested inside of other collections ([CHO-216](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/216))
