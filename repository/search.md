# Search Repository

As a User, I would like the ability to search the Repository, so that I can find Objects that are of interest to me in my research, scholarship, or instruction.

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Display related search results ([CHO-111](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/111)) (Relate on: subject, collection, author, time period, etc.)
- [ ] Display excerpts of text or metadata with search query highlighted, in search result summary ([CHO-156](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/156))
