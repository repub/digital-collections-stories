# View Collection

As a User, I would like a page about each Collection in the Public User Interface, so that I can see all of the Works and metadata for that Collection in one place.

## CONTENTdm

Edwin Forbes Civil War Etchings: [Drupal](https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/edwin-forbes-civil-war-etchings), [CONTENTdm](https://digital.libraries.psu.edu/digital/collection/Forbes/search)

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Display example Works
- [ ] Link to Create New Work page (for authenticated users) ([CHO-446](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/446))

## Benchmarks

## User feedback

Henry Pisciotta:

> The collection page is an advertisement about the collection, but many users will then want to see a number of examples, before deciding what might make useful searches. So a browsing function that is somewhere between the advert of the collection page and the specificity of the search seems very important. Some new systems even put this type of display forward more prominently than an overall written description. For example, many newer interfaces do a random display of images or something similar. Think about Netflix or Kanopy for example.
