# Create Object

As a Curator, I would like the ability to create new Works, so that I may add more material to the Repository. ([CHO-375](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/375))

## It should

- [ ] Pass accessibility tests
- [ ] Be responsively designed ([CHO-138](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/138))
- [ ] Support simple ([CHO-375](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/375)) and nested ([CHO-408]((https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/408)) works
- [ ] Generate thumbnails ([CHO-168](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/168))

## It would be nice if it could

- [ ] Import works as zipped Bags ([CHO-553]((https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/553))
- [ ] Save incomplete works (e.g. metadata without objects; metadata lacking all required properties) ([CHO-97](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/97))
- [ ] Save in background while work is in progress ([CHO-188](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/188))
- [ ] Automatically generate text/OCR payload for textual materials ([CHO-153](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/153))
- [ ] Assign Objects to a Curated Collection on create or ingest ([CHO-416](https://github.com/psu-libraries/cho/issues/416))
